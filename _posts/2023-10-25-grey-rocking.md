# Protect yourself

In the presence of a genuinely harmful person, don't exacerbate the situation by reacting.  

Truly there is nothing productive about it and you'll destroy yourself in the process.
Your search for validation and heartfelt compassion will lead you astray leaving you out to dry by pleasing other people's demands.

Remeber, no contact. Leave from the situation to save yourself.
