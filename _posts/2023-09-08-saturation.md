## Saturation Crash Course

Saturation is one of the most important topics in music production. Saturation along with EQ and compression make up the most important tools we have for shaping sounds. Saturation adds warmth and character to a track and can make a track more professional sounding (allegedly). [^1]

The basics of saturation and harmonics will lay the groundwork for more advanced topics in [[distortion]].

Why do we use it?

### Saturation adds frequencies

Another way to describe it is that Saturation adds overtones as in a direct multiple of the fundamental pitch:

    Tones, overtones, harmonics, and partials
    The base, or core, frequency of a sound is known as its fundamental tone.

    The waveforms of all sounds, apart from a basic sine wave, consist of the fundamental tone and many other tones of different frequencies.

    Non-fundamental tones that are whole-number multiples of the fundamental tone are known as overtones or harmonics. A tone with a frequency that is a fraction of the fundamental tone is referred to as a subharmonic.

    The fundamental tone is referred to as the first harmonic. This is generally louder than the other harmonics.

    A tone played at twice the frequency of the first harmonic is called the second harmonic.

    A tone played at four times the frequency of the first harmonic is called the fourth harmonic, and so on.

    Each of these harmonics has a timbral quality that is different from that of the fundamental tone. In general, harmonics that can be multiplied or divided by a whole number, such as octaves, odd-numbered or even-numbered harmonics, and so on, sound more “musical.”

    Tones that cannot be multiplied or divided by a whole number are known as inharmonic overtones, or partial tones. When you combine a number of these inharmonic overtones, it tends to sound “noisy.”

    Non-fundamental tones that are multiplied by fractional amounts—not whole numbers—are called partials.
