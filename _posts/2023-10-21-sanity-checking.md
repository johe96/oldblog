With the increasing popularity of social media like Twitter, and Reddit, the potential of bad info and blatant misinformation will inevitably increase as well.

A thing I've notice over the years by observing certaint rhetoric around Twitter regarding heavy political events, it always seems to be the case that we assume good will and that everyone is observing reality similarly.

In most cases, this is not true. People don't actually process things the same as you might believe, similarly to how two sets of people can at face value identify that a colour is "red" but in reality, these two sets of people are looking at different shades of red and green. One set is colorbind but the kind of shade that they're seeing is still defined as "red" in their eyes because that's all they know.

You might've stumbled upon certain arguments where you never seem to be able to agree on something. That's where the sanity checks starts and stops.

People generally do seem to "think" that they all are cohesive and have the same values in life and for the most part, that is true. Problem is that we don't see the same shades of red or green even if we've compartmentalized it as such.

What's "good" today was not "good" 50 years back.
