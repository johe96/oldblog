## Draft text

the presumption that everything needs to be re-told and re-explained without context.

the fact that most of the things we know and learn about base 10 is mostly intuitive and never thought of just like how a native language speaker never have to think about language syntax or even are able to explain the grammatical structure aobut their own language.

When we realize that certain things we already have partial knowledge of, it's important to fill the gaps in knowledge by asking clarifying questions as setp-by-step raw technical teaching can hamper your understanding as most people don't have the a priori knowledge of knowing the context of certain concepts, why they're told about, what they're used for and its importance.

When it comes to things like binary and base 10, the numbering system that we use daily; by knowing that small fact that we already have the knowledge and are using base 10, meaning that we took arithmetics in order to do calculations and nubmer operations for solving problems, it means that we already have an understanding of what binary system is going to be.

Contrast that to someone that comes into the field of computer science with no heads up about your previous knowledge and how/why we use base 10, then the learning journey will become increasingly harder, especially if you're not supplementing your gap in knowledge by not asking.

Embarassing to say but at my age, it's way too late to realize this fact.
